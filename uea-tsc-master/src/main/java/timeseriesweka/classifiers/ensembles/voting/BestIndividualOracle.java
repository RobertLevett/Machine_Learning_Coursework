/**
 * TODO what if there's tie for best? UNTESTED
 * 
 * The ensemble's distribution for an instance is equal to the single 'best' individual,
 * as defined by THEIR TEST ACCURACY. Results must have been read from file (i.e test preds
 * already exist at train time) Weighting scheme is irrelevant, only considers accuracy.
 * 
 * Mostly just written so that I can do the best individual within the existing framework for 
 * later testing
